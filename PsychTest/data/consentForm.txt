for the researcher or doctor's psychological study or for treatment purposes. The consent being 
acquired here may either be for research purposes, for clinical findings for disorders, or for 
clinical assessment of a patient or client, among others. The informed consent lets participants 
understand the purpose of the research, the duration of the research and/or the conducting of 
acquiring the information from the participant, and the possible risks and consequences involved 
if there is any in conducting the activity. On having an informed consent, the researcher asks 
the participant to sign a written informed consent before taking part in the study.
